To build the library in Linux environment (you must have autotool), execute the following commands:
autoreconf -fi
./configure
make

To install the library in your system (you must have sudo previlege) do:
sudo make install

To use the library, include the following header file in your program:

#include <hof/hof.hpp>

Currently (12/21/2010) only the C++ class for generating HoF from raster data has been tested. 
The class hof::HoF_Raster supports the creation of HoF from raster data. 
For sample code that use hof::HoF_Raster please read tests/HoFRasterTestSuite.hpp.

Further explanation on the data structure in hof::HoF_Raster, please read the documentation in src/raster/HoF_Raster.hpp.

The library is initially built using cxxtest library to perform unit test.
The unit test for raster data is given in tests/HoFRasterTestSuite.hpp.
This unit test also requires gdal library. Since cxxtest and gdal are not standard in linux,
we disable the unit testing protocol for this version.

To re-enable the unit testing protocol, you must install cxxtest and gdal, then uncomment lines 21 to 24 in configure.ac, and in Makefile.am add "tests" as follows:

SUBDIRS = doc src tests

Then rebuilt the library using autotool (see top of document).
