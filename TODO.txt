Add in the code that visualizes the FIS rule outputs.
    It's in the PhD repo, need to add it here

Now streamline all this code so it isn't just scattered everywhere.
Figure out how to install the dependencies for the python HOF using conda.
    May not be possible. Look it up.
    Uses pybind.
    Need to go back through the conda environment file and add/remove what I need/don't need.

Should just only have to change the level one utils algorithm to use the python HOF. Will make the code a
lot cleaner most likely. Basically, do the below:

Convert HOF to use the Python scripts created by Dr. Anderson's group.
    Replace all the MatLab code with Python and update the pipeline.
        May not need to store CSV/Json files for everything anymore.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing now with Python 3.10 and venv
Need to still test with a conda environment and pip installing the requirements


To use the HOFPY script, I'll have to create a mask image for the input to the HOF script.
I did something similar in matlab, need to do this and then grab all of the hof outputs.
    After getting the output, need to examine what exactly is in there. Are there NaNs?


I think I have the HoFpy incorporated. What I'll need to do is run all of these results off again.

First make sure the FIS is working. Verify the last part of the system.
