Add in the code that visualizes the FIS rule outputs.
    It's in the PhD repo, need to add it here

Now streamline all this code so it isn't just scattered everywhere.
Figure out how to install the dependencies for the python HOF using conda.
    May not be possible. Look it up.
    Uses pybind.
    Need to go back through the conda environment file and add/remove what I need/don't need.

Should just only have to change the level one utils algorithm to use the python HOF. Will make the code a
lot cleaner most likely. Basically, do the below:

Convert HOF to use the Python scripts created by Dr. Anderson's group.
    Replace all the MatLab code with Python and update the pipeline.
